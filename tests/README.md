# Test Directory Structure

This directory contains all test files for the Python Test Framework project. The tests are organized by type and functionality.

## ðŸ“ˆ Code Coverage (for Beginners)

**Code coverage** measures how much of your code is exercised by your tests. High coverage helps ensure your code is well-tested and less likely to have hidden bugs.

### Why is coverage important?
- It shows which parts of your code are tested and which are not.
- Helps you find untested edge cases.
- Encourages writing more robust tests.

### How to check coverage

1. **Install dependencies** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
   This will install `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, and other tools.

2. **Run all tests with coverage:**
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing -v
   ```
   - `--cov=src` tells pytest to measure coverage for the `src/` directory.
   - `--cov-report=term-missing` shows which lines are not covered.
   - `-v` gives verbose output.

3. **Generate an HTML coverage report (optional):**
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
   ```
   - This creates an `htmlcov/` folder. Open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser to see a visual report.

#### Example output
```
---------- coverage: platform darwin, python 3.11.8 ----------
Name                        Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
---------------------------------------------------------
src/openapi_client.py         180      0   100%
...
---------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                        900      0   100%
```

#### Troubleshooting
- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError`, make sure you installed all dependencies.
- If coverage is less than 100%, check the `Missing` column for lines not covered and add tests for them.
- If you want to test a specific file or folder, use:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=src/path/to/file.py
  ```

- Test data factories
- Environment configurations
- Cleanup utilities
- Mock objects

## Running Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

To run tests in a specific directory:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/
pytest tests/performance/
```

To run tests with specific markers:
```bash
pytest -m "slow"
pytest -m "integration"
```
